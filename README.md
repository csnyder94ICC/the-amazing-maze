# The Amazing Maze

## By Joshua Carroll, Samantha Ruppe, and Christopher Snyder

## Description

In this Python-based maze game project, we use lists and tuples to store rooms and scenarios, allowing players to explore and make choices. Our game incorporates decision structures to handle player choices, repetition structures to keep the game running until the player decides to exit or reaches an end condition, and it even includes functionality to save and load game states using file operations. Embark on an exciting journey through intricate mazes, make crucial decisions, and challenge your problem-solving skills in this interactive gaming experience!
